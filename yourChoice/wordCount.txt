Word Count

Write a program to count the frequencies of unique words from standard input, then print them out with their frequencies, ordered most frequent to least frequent.


Example

Given this input:
The foo the foo the
defenestration the

The program should print the following:
the 4
foo 2
defenestration 1


Input File

Constraints

The program must normalize words to lowercase, so "The the THE" should appear as "the 3" in the output
A word is anything separated by whitespace - ignore punctuation
It's okay to only support ASCII for the whitespace handling and lowercase operation
If the frequency of two words is the same, their order in the output doesn't matter
The program should run in a single thread on a single machine
Don't read the whole file into memory
Use only the language's standard library functions
