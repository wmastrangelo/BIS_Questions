Thank you for interviewing with us. You will find four folders. Your goal for the two GIFs is to recreate the demonstrated code as closely as possible. One is a CSS focused problem(/css/CSSexercise.gif) and other is a JavaScript focused problem(/js/JSexercise.gif). The go and yourChoise folders are two other problems to solve with examples in each. The exercises are open book with no strict time limit, although we do expect them to be completed within a two to three days. If an external problem arises that prevents you from completing the questions in the allotted time, please make us aware so that necessary arrangements can be made. 

Save your code to a GitHub (or similar) repository and provide the links back to us.
